# Hi there 👋🏾 I'm Selam 
I'm a developer in the making with a passion for front end design but also just coding in general! <br>

I like to experiment with code as much as I can in order to learn new ways to interact with it.<br>

When I'm not coding, I will either be drawing/painting or playing video games, the latter of which inspired some of my projects.<br>
<br>
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: My portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Java
