# Hi there 👋🏾 I'm Selam 

I'm a Full-stack developer with a passion for front-end design but also just coding in general! <br>

I like to experiment with code as much as I can to learn new ways to interact with it.<br>

When I'm not coding, I will either be drawing/painting or playing video games, the latter of which inspired some of my projects.<br>
