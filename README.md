# Hi there I'm Selam 
I'm a developer in the making with a passion for front end design but also just coding in general! 
I like to push the boundaries and experiment with code as much as I can in order to learn new ways to interact with it.
When I'm not coding, I will either be drawing/painting or playing video games, the latter of which inspired some of my projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: My first full-stack web app
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Back-end Development
